The following outlines the conventions used throughout this dissertation.

\section*{Notation}
\begin{trivlist}
	\item $\naturals = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$, the set of natural numbers -- positive integers \emph{not} including $0$.
	\item $\naturals_0 = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$, the set of nonnegative integers.
	\item $\reals^+ = \{a \in \reals \mid a \geq 0\}$, the set of nonnegative real numbers including $0$.
\end{trivlist}

\section*{Propositions, theorems, examples, etc.}
Throughout this dissertation a black square $\blacksquare$ marks the end of each definition, remark and results where the proof has been omitted. If we have a claim within a proof, then the proof of the claim is also marked with a black square.

A white square $\square$ is used to mark the end of all other proofs.
